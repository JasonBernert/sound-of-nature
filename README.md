## The Sound Of Nature
One day I was sitting in a crowded room on the ground floor of a building downtown and I wondered what  would've been there if the building was never built, the city never established, and the people never there. Though impossible to know ([and a philosophical conundrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito_ergo_sum)), it did make me wonder what natural sounds are accessible programmatically and if they could be stitched together  as a soundscape to attempt to hear what any place on earth would sound like without human interference.

### APIs for different sounds:
Each soundscape stitches together the following sounds from their respective APIs.
* [Weather](http://openweathermap.org/current)
* [Bird sounds](http://www.xeno-canto.org/article/153)

### Technology
Each soundscape stitches together the following sounds from their respective APIs.
* [Leaflet](http://openweathermap.org/current) for the map services
